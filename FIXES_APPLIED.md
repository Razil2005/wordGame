# Fixes Applied for Multiplayer Game Issues

## Problem 1: Duplicate Player Names ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Player names appeared twice in the players list
**Root Cause**: Multiple event handlers and potential duplicate player entries
**Fixes Applied**:
1. **Server-side**: Added logging to `addPlayer` method to track player additions
2. **Client-side**: Modified `updatePlayersList` to use unique player tracking via Map
3. **Client-side**: Added data attributes for debugging and preventing duplicates
4. **Client-side**: Enhanced logging to track player list updates

## Problem 2: Non-working "New Game" and "Leave Room" Buttons ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Buttons were visible but clicking them did nothing
**Root Cause**: Missing function implementations
**Fixes Applied**:
1. **Added `startNewGame()` function**:
   - Checks if user is connected and is the host
   - Emits `newGame` event to server
   - Shows appropriate notifications
   
2. **Added `leaveRoom()` function**:
   - Resets all game state (roomId, isHost, gameState, playerName)
   - Clears form inputs
   - Returns to welcome screen
   - Shows notification

## Testing Instructions

### Test Problem 1 Fix (No Duplicate Names):
1. Open two browser windows at `http://localhost:3001`
2. In Window 1: Enter name "Alice", click "Create Room"
3. In Window 2: Enter name "Bob", click "Join Room", enter room code, click "Join Game"
4. **Expected**: Each player should appear only once in the players list

### Test Problem 2 Fix (Working Buttons):
1. Complete a game (let someone win or health reach zero)
2. Game over screen should show "New Game" (for host) and "Leave Room" buttons
3. **Test "New Game" button**:
   - Only host should see this button
   - Clicking should start a new word immediately
   - All players should see the new game screen
4. **Test "Leave Room" button**:
   - Any player can click this
   - Should return to welcome screen
   - All form fields should be cleared

## Server Logging
The server now logs when players are added:
```
Player Alice (socket123) added/updated in room ABC123. Total players: 1
Player Bob (socket456) added/updated in room ABC123. Total players: 2
```

## Client Logging
The client now logs unique player tracking:
```
Added 2 unique players to display
```

Both issues have been resolved with comprehensive fixes and enhanced debugging capabilities.
