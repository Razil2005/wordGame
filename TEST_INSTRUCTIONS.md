# Testing the Fixed Multiplayer Game

## How to Test the Fixes

1. **Start the Server**
   ```
   cd "C:\Users\Razil\Desktop\newgame"
   node server.js
   ```

2. **Open Two Browser Windows/Tabs**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3001` in both
   - This simulates two players

3. **Test Room Creation and Joining**
   
   **In Browser 1 (Host):**
   1. Enter a name (e.g., "Alice")
   2. Click "Create Room"
   3. You should see:
      - Room code displayed (e.g., "Room: ABC123")
      - "Alice" listed in the Players section with "HOST" badge
      - "Start Game" button visible
   
   **In Browser 2 (Player):**
   1. Enter a name (e.g., "Bob")
   2. Click "Join Room"
   3. Enter the room code from Browser 1
   4. Click "Join Game"
   5. You should see:
      - Same room code
      - Both "Alice (HOST)" and "Bob (PLAYER)" in Players list
      - No "Start Game" button (only host can see it)
   
   **Back in Browser 1:**
   - Should now see both players listed
   - "Start Game" button should still be visible

4. **Test Game Flow**
   - Host clicks "Start Game"
   - Both players should see the game screen with word mask, hints, and input
   - Players can guess letters or the full word
   - Health decreases with wrong guesses

## What Was Fixed

✅ **Players list now shows all connected users**
✅ **Start Game button appears only for the host**
✅ **Real-time updates when players join/leave**
✅ **Proper game state synchronization**
✅ **User feedback notifications work**

## If Issues Persist

Check the browser console (F12) for any error messages and verify:
1. Server is running on port 3001
2. No JavaScript errors in console
3. Network tab shows successful WebSocket connections
